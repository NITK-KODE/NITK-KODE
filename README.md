# NITK-KODE

NITK KODE is a group of passionate programmers from NITK Batch 2024.
- We aspire to improve the development as well as the coding culture in our institution.
- Trying to take NIT-K Coding and Development culture to the next level.

## How can we encourage everyone to contribute?
- ask them how can you encourage everyone to contribute.
- Spamming a message among mates explaining the issues and technology they need to solve the issue can encourage them to contribute. Then they can relate them, whether they can fit to contribute to that issue.
This can help because
- It will make them aware of the issue
- They will have more clarity about it
-Some easy issues can also be created to initiate the culture of contribution among students.
